# Verinest - Real Estate Platform for Africa

## Overview
Verinest is a modern real estate platform designed to tackle the unique challenges of Africa’s property market. It provides a trusted, transparent, and scalable digital infrastructure for buying, renting, and managing properties. The project was built as part of a hackathon to address real-world inefficiencies in Africa’s real estate industry, including lack of trust, poor property verification, limited access to property financing, and fragmented housing data.

## Problem Statement
The African real estate market faces several persistent issues:
- **Trust and Fraud:** Property scams, fake listings, and unverified agents reduce trust.
- **Access to Information:** Lack of reliable property data makes decision-making difficult.
- **Affordability and Financing:** Many potential buyers and renters struggle with financing options.
- **Fragmented Market:** Property listings are scattered across multiple platforms, with no standardization.

## Solution
Verinest introduces a verified, user-centered, and scalable ecosystem to address these problems:
1. **User Authentication and Verification** - Secure onboarding with referral support to build trusted networks.
2. **Verified Listings** - Properties go through a strict verification process to eliminate fraud.
3. **Referral-based Growth** - Existing users invite new users with referral codes, ensuring organic trust chains.
4. **Dashboard Experience** - Each user gets a personalized dashboard with verified properties, saved searches, and referrals.
5. **Cross-platform Accessibility** - Responsive design for seamless use on desktop and mobile devices.
6. **Scalable API Infrastructure** - Built on a robust backend with authentication, user management, and property endpoints.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (with hooks and context API for state management), TailwindCSS for UI.
